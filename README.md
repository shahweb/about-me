### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shah!

I'm working as a Design Systems Designer at Paramount+.

ðŸ“– What I have been working on for the past year:

I have been working on and helping build the Voyager Design Systems and collaborating with cross-functional teams including designers, developers, and product managers to ensure that the design system is aligned with business and user needs.

    * Predominantly work in Figma and Github, designing tokenized components
    * Alongside creating the documentaion, theming and hand-off

I have been creating and help maintaining style guides and code libraries to ensure that design elements are implemented consistently across different platforms and devices. I am continuously iterating on and updating the design system based on designers/developers feedback, testing, and changing business needs. 

ðŸ“‘ Current project 
    
    * Researching, Defining and creating design principles, patterns, and components
    * Building multiplatform UI Kit using the Design Tokens
    * Shipping Design Tokens to developers to code libraries and style guides
    * Designing and developing UI components, and ensuring that they are consistent and efficient to use
    * Managing the design system as a product and being accountable for its success
    * Continuously testing, evaluating and improving the design system over time
    
Overall, My goal is to improve communication and collaboration between designers, developers, and other stakeholders, and to make it easier to create and maintain a consistent, high-quality user experience.
